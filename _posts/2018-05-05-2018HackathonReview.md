**The weekend of February 9-11 2018 was an exciting one for healthcare innovation in Hamilton. Over 70 participants gathered to form a dozen teams to hack together digital solutions for big healthcare problems.**

### Friday night: Pitches & team formation
We started out at 5pm with a pitch clinic to help project owners craft a great pitch in the event, while everyone had a chance to network at the reception, with light food and refreshments. Our official program began at 7pm with Nicolas Piperno, who came from Toronto to MC the weekend. 
Then the idea owners went on stage to pitch their ideas for projects. We had more than 20 fantastic one-minute idea pitches on Friday night. Some teams were already formed coming into the event, but most were looking for members, so there was a lot of activity as people networked and selected ideas and project teams. 


### Saturday: Hacking, mentoring, and 3D printing
Bright and early at 8am we provided breakfast and the teams got to work. The hackers were seriously on mission! The hacked all day and most stayed until we closed the doors at 10pm.
We were fortunate to have an amazing group of 12 mentors from different settings of healthcare, IT, entrepreneurs, business people, and a patient advocate. During the afternoon, a dozen invited mentors introduced themselves to the teams and mentored the teams. We ran scheduled mentoring, with the mentors divided into three groups, each in their own conference room. From 1pm to 4pm we ran the teams through the mentoring rooms and each team had a chance to practice their pitch and get valuable feedback from two different groups of mentors.
3D printing and design support was available on site, thanks to the generous volunteering of Nicholas Andreae. He helped teams to design and print prototypes.

### Sunday: Finishing touches and judging

Sunday morning was a lot like Saturday but a nervous energy could be felt at MIP. The judges arrived at noon and spent an hour before the final pitch presentations, talking to teams and getting to know with their works. The last hours before final pitch were quite busy, with teams preparing for the final pitch presentation and then at 1pm sharp the final ceremony started.
Each team had four minutes to present their work and judges ask questions for two minutes after that. After presenting all projects, judges deliberated for half an hour and finally at 4pm the winners were announced, and the prizes were given out. The final ceremony ended with a group photo of almost 80 hard-working individuals who believe: Together, we're bringing innovation to healthcare in Hamilton!

### Our judging panel
Our judging panel was made up of healthcare innovators, educators and hackathon pros.

Thanks to our volunteers:

Hacking Health is a 100% volunteer grassroots group. It’s a cliché, but we couldn’t have put on this event without our volunteers. Planning, logistics and implementing for this event started in the fall of 2017 and was practically a full-time job for almost two months before to make sure everything was onboard, planned and the whole weekend ran smoothly.
We’d like to thank our co-leaders:
David Kemper: Information professional specializing in digital experience & tech trends at McMaster University
Cynthia Lokker: Assistant Professor; MSC eHealth FHS Lead at McMaster University
Simon Woodside: Co-founder & CTO of MedStack


We have an amazing volunteer team, including:
Genevieve Jin
Yasir Khalid
Deborah Koenig
Dora Laurent
Hamideh Nasseh
Christina Nirta

And we’d also like to thank the group of volunteers who came out and shared their energy and enthusiasm to help organisers in holding this hackathon.

### What is Hacking Health?
Hacking Health Hamilton is a digital health innovation organization, part of the Hacking Health global movement of grassroots groups in more than 40 cities around the world - Canada, USA, Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa and Tunisia. We bring together health care professionals, meta users, entrepreneurs, innovators, developers, designers among others to work on the opportunities available in the healthcare industry.

Every year since 2016, we run a Hacking Health hackathon. At a hackathon, ideas for projects are pitched on Friday night, participants align themselves with a project of interest and form teams, and these teams ‘hack’ a prototype solution over the course of Saturday and Sunday. Our hackathon runs over a weekend and allows innovators, both neophyte and experienced, to create prototypes and compete for prizes such as valuable support from local and national organizations.
