This month, [CoMotion On King](http://www.comotiongroup.ca/comotion-on-king/) hosted hosting our first Meetup of the 2019 Meetup season in Downtown Hamilton.

We have a panel of past Hacking Health Hamilton Hackathon winners discuss their project and their life as healthcare innovators following their hackathon experience.
